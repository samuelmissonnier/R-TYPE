   The server will send informations of users on the client socket.

   Client socket is handle by the server.

   Every clients will write on his socket.

   Commands and replies can take parameters.

2.1.  Parameter Information

   have an unique name.

   - GAME_NAME : this is the name of a game, every game need to have an
   unique name.

   - ERROR : this is an error description. (exemple: "login already
   used")

   - MAP : this is a map of all entity, every entity will be send like
